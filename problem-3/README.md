# Problem 2 - Javascript Logic

### Notes
- A json file was created to keep good readability and cleanliness in the solution file.
- JSDocs was used to document the code.
- It should run in a development server (eg. Tomcat, Webstorm IDE, etc.). 
otherwise, if run locally browser could block the js file load due to CORS.
In order to make it work CORS should be disabled (e.g. using a browser extension that temporarily disables it).
